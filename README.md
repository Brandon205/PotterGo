# PotterGO
PotterGo is a 1-day Hackathon project hosted by General Assembly Seattle, that was developed by [Nick Shankland](https://github.com/cerebrium) and I. It was designed by a group of designers by the names of Alyssa Evans, Huda Malik, and Shoshanna Thomas-McCue. It is an app that allows users to have a PokemonGo like experience, but with a Harry Potter themed Twist!

## Languages/Frameworks used
We incorporated React with hooks, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.

## The Process
Working with a team of UX-Designers was a good experience and it was nice as developers to not need to come up with all of the UX choices ourselves, and instead to have a group of people be able to go around and ask people to make sure that everything was laid out in a user-friendly way. Creating the app and its features was also not too bad. Suprisingly enough we were able to get MapBox fully functioning along with a few little minigames before time was out.
This project was got 1st place because of the amount of features we were able to get working in the time limit along with the well detailed thought process on our design and layout for the app.
